## Abstract {.page_break_before}
The *Cucurbita* genus is home to a number of economically and culturally important species. 
We present the analysis of genotype data generated through genotyping-by-sequencing of the USDA germplasm collections of *Cucurbita pepo*, *C. moschata*, and *C. maxima*. 
These collections include a mixture of wild, landrace, and cultivated specimens from all over the world. 
Roughly 1,500 - 32,000 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were called in each of the collections, which ranged in size from 314 to 829 accessions. 
Genomic analyses were conducted to characterize the diversity in each of the species and revealed extensive structure corresponding to a combination of geographical origin and morphotype/market class. 
Genome-wide associate study (GWAS) was conducted for each data set using both historical and contemporary data, and signals were detected for several traits, including the bush gene (Bu) in *C. pepo*. 
These data represent the largest collection of sequenced Cucurbita and can be used to direct the maintenance of genetic diversity and the development of breeding resources, and to help prioritize whole-genome re-sequencing for further GWAS and other genomics studies aimed at understanding the phenotypic and genetic diversity present in Cucurbita.
