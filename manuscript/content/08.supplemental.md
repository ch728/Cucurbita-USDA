![Spatial distribution of filtered markers for each species.](../../supplemental/01_supfig.png){#fig:mrk}

![Cross-validation error  plots used to pick the optimum K value for admixture analysis. The K value that minimizes cross-validation error, and thus chosen for the final analysis, is labeled with a red point.](../../supplemental/02_supfig.png){#fig:cv}

![Results from running GenoCore in each of the panels. Panel a shows the PCA plots for each panel with accessions selected by GenoCore represented as black points. Panel b shows the proportion of total accessions needed to obtain a certain coverage of diversity.](../../supplemental/03_supfig.png){#fig:genocore}
